Goal: THe goal of this project was to learn how to take tweets from Twitter, and turn them into some sort of informative visual representation. 
Analysis: The data I dend up analyzing was Tweets from the Dallas Cowboys. In my visualization, I recorded how many Tweets the official @dallascowboys account made on each day in the last week.
cont. I found that they Tweeted much more on SUnday, 9/18 and Monday, 9/19 than the other days. I believe that this is because they played, and won, their game on Sunday. These are both reasons for a sports team to be cative on social media. 
(I have anecdotally observed the teams I follow post much less on their socials after defeats.)

Data types: 
Date and time: a unique data type which contains the exact date and time (in UTC +0) when a Tweet was created.
September date: an int containing a 2-digit number signifying the day in September which the associated Tweet was created. Note that all data goes back 1 week.
ID: aan int of a unique ID of each tweet. Note that each cell in Excel shows up in scientific notation, but is unique when individually clicked on.
Context annotations: an array containing many different identifiers of each tweet. These include domain, id, and a description of the topic.
Known issues: data only goes back one week, limiting the data to about 130 Tweets in that time frame.
